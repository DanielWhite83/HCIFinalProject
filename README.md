# HCIFinalProject

This is the code for my final project which was changing the UI of the YouTube like/dislike feature.

I incorporated this onto my personal website which has a lot of existing code for appearance and color schemes, so if you attempt to pull and view the website locally, it won't look very good (though the buttons will still work as intended). If you want to view the actual prototype as it is intended, it is hosted on my personal website:
